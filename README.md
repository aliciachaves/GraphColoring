# GraphColoring

The C++ program receives a pre-colored graph and checks if its coloring is greedy. If it isn't, the program stops. Otherwise, it sorts the vertices based on each one's color number, using the following sorting methods: BubbleSort, SelectionSort, InsertionSort, Quicksort, Mergesort, and Heapsort.
